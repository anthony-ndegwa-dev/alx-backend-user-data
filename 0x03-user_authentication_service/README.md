# User authentication service

## Back-end   Authentification

## Objectives
* Declare API routes in a Flask app
* Get and set cookies
* Retrieve request form data
* Return various HTTP status codes

## Requirements
* Use the pycodestyle style `version 2.5`
* Use SQLAlchemy 1.3.x
* All modules should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')`
* All functions should be type annotated
* The flask app should only interact with Auth and never with DB directly
* Only public methods of Auth and DB should be used outside these classes

## Setup
* You will need to install bcrypt
  - `pip3 install bcrypt`
